# Delete Middle Node
### Cracking the Coding Interview 6th Ed.

Chapter 2: Linked Lists

Interview Question 2.3

Implement an algorithm to delete a node in the middle (i.e. any node but the first and last node, not necessarily the exact middle) of a singly linked list, given only access to that node.


#### Example
***Input:*** the node 'c' from the linked list **a->b->c->d->e->f**

***Output:*** Nothing is returned, but the new linked list looks linked **a->b->d->e->f**
