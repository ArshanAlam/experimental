### Cracking the Coding Interview 6th Ed.

Chapter 2: Linked Lists

Interview Question 2.5



You have two numbers represented by linked list, where each node contains a
single digit. The digits are stored in reverse order, such that 1's digit is at
the head of the list. Write a function that adds the two numbers and returns the
sum as a linked list.


#### Example:

**Input:** (7 -> 1 -> 6) + (5 -> 9 -> 2) *[That is 617 + 295]*
**Output:** 2 -> 1 -> 9 *[Answer is 912]*


Suppose the digits are stored in forward order. Repeat the above problem.
**Input:** (6 -> 1 -> 7) + (2 -> 9 -> 5) *[That is 617 + 295]*
**Output:** 9 -> 1 -> 2 *[Answer is 912]*
