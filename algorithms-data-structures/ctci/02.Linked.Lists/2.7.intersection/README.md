# Intersection
### Cracking the Coding Interview 6th Ed.

Chapter 2: Linked Lists

Interview Question 2.7

Given two (singly) linked lists, determine if the two lists intersect. Return the intersecting node. Note, that the intersection is defined based on reference, not value. This is, if the Kth node of the first linked list is the exact same node (by reference) as the jth node of the second linked list, then they are intersecting.

**NOTE:** A verification function is written to check for correction.
