Chapter 1: Arrays and Strings

Interview Question 1.4

Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palindrome. A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same forwards and backwards. A permutation is a rearrangement of letters. The palindrome does not need to be limited to just dictionary words.


#### Example

**Input:** tact coa

**Output:** True *(**permutations:** "taco cat", "atco cta", etc.)*


**NOTE:** Ignore space character when processing the string, and assume the the input string is in ASCII.
