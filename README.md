# Sandbox
This is a [monorepo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo) of mini-projects, tutorials, algorithms, data structures, system design, and anything else that I've worked on. Traditionally I would create individual repos for these, however it became too painful to maintain. Thus, I added all those little repos into a single large repo.

## Topics Covered
- [Algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm)
- [Data Structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure)
- [Machine Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning)
- [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)
- [Cracking the Coding Interview](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cracking_the_Coding_Interview)
