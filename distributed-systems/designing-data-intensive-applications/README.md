# Designing Data-Intensive Applications: The Big Ideas Behind Reliable, Scalable, and Maintainable Systems
by Martin Kleppmann

## Preface

* Internet companies are handling huge volumes of data and traffic, forcing them to create new tools that enable them efficiently handle such scale
* An application is *data-intensive* if the quantity of data, the complexity of data, or the speed at which it is changing is the primary challenge
* After reading this book, you will be in a great position to decided which kind of technology is appropriate for which purpose, and understand how tools can be combined to form the foundation of a good application architecture
